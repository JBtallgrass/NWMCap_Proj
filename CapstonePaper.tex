\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Context}
Across rural regions in the United States, economic development is increasingly tied to the alignment between educational attainment and workforce demands.  In North Central Arkansas, where post-secondary access is limited by geographic, technological, and economic barriers, institutions of higher learning and workforce development boards face growing pressure to ensure that educational programming corresponds to actual labor market needs \cite{ecs2021,wadhwani2020,apprenticeship2021}. Despite numerous initiatives, a persistent gap remains between the skills that local employers demand and the qualifications provided by regional education and training pipelines \cite{ecs2021,wadhwani2020}. This misalignment not only weakens economic resilience but also exacerbates social disparities among under served populations. Addressing this challenge requires a data-informed understanding of both education outputs and employment forecasts at the regional level. The project investigates the alignment between post-secondary education programs and occupational demand in North Central Arkansas. Using publicly available datasets and a predictive modeling approach grounded in the CRISP-DM framework, the project aims to quantify mismatches between educational output and workforce needs across high-growth industries. The scope of analysis includes six counties in the North Central region, focusing on two-year colleges, workforce training programs, and relevant labor market indicators. The study also considers structural barriers to workforce participation, such as internet access and geographic isolation.

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To what extent are current post-secondary education programs aligned with regional labor market demands in North Central Arkansas?
    \item What are the most significant gaps between educational outputs and job opportunities by sector or occupation?
    \item How do geographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructural variables influence education-to-employment transitions in the region?
    \item What data-driven recommendations can be made to regional stakeholders to improve alignment and support equitable workforce development?
\end{itemize}

\section{Regional and Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Overview of North Central Arkansas}
North Central Arkansas is characterized by its rural geography, aging population, and limited industrial diversification. The region encompasses several counties that exhibit lower-than-average post-secondary attainment and median household income when compared to state and national benchmarks \cite{ncarlocal2020,discover2022}. Employment is concentrated in healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and seasonal tourism. However, population out migration, infrastructure limitations, and uneven economic development present systemic barriers to workforce sustainability. These contextual factors underscore the importance of aligning educational programs with real labor market needs to retain talent and build long-term economic resilience.

\subsection{Education and Workforce Policy Context}
In recent years, Arkansas has launched several statewide initiatives aimed at workforce readiness and educational innovation, including the Arkansas Future Grant, the Re-imagine Arkansas Workforce Project, and the Career Coach Program \cite{ncarlocal2020,careertech2020}. While these programs have produced promising outcomes in select areas, implementation at the regional level remains uneven. Community colleges and technical centers are critical nodes in the state’s talent pipeline, yet they often face challenges in maintaining up-to-date programming, tracking graduate outcomes, and aligning curricula with employer needs \cite{careertech2020,jff2024}. This disconnect limits the efficacy of regional workforce development strategies.

\subsection{Conceptual Framework}
This research is grounded in human capital theory, which posits that investments in education and training enhance individual productivity and, by extension, economic growth \cite{usda2005}. The project also draws on labor market signaling theory, suggesting that degrees and credentials communicate value to employers, but only when aligned with current market demands. Additionally, the framework incorporates rural development theory to account for geographic and infrastructural constraints, as well as principles of equity to assess who benefits—and who is left behind—when educational systems fail to respond to regional labor realities \cite{ruralinnovation2023}.
