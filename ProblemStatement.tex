Problem Statement
Rural counties in north-central Arkansas face persistent challenges related to educational attainment, broadband access, and economic opportunities. As the region seeks to strengthen its workforce and retain talent, there is growing concern that local education and training programs may not align with the demands of the current and emerging job market. Despite efforts to expand community college offerings and workforce development initiatives, it remains unclear whether residents have the skills required for high-growth, middle-skill occupations.

This project seeks to investigate the alignment between educational outcomes and labor market needs in select rural counties. Using open-source data and machine learning techniques, the analysis will identify patterns in workforce readiness and highlight counties that may be at risk for long-term employment and training gaps. The goal is to generate actionable insights that support regional planning, funding strategies, and curriculum development, with a focus on strengthening the education-to-employment pipeline in underserved rural communities.
